# Projet-Structure de données---IMdb to MongoDB clusters
### Authors : **Nicolas CARVAL** - **Quentin NAVARRE** - **Bruno PINCET**

Here is our work for the final project of Structure de données pour le Cloud.

In this repository you will find :

- The **Mongo application** in order to run our Vue.
- A **Jupiter Notebook** (Denormalisation.ipng), containing the script for dernomalisation.
- A **Jupiter Notebook** (Performance.ipng), containing the script for measuring performances of different sharding and number of replicas.


### Context:
Given a SQL Database we had to work on it in order to transform it into a NoSQL DB to then create a cluster of virtual machines and test which configurations (1 server or N server, sharding on X or Y) gave the best performance in terms of time to answer.

We had to then create an app in order to visualize queries.

### Visualisation of our APP :
